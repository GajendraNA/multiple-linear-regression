Here’s a clean README.md for your project 👇

# Multiple Linear Regression Project

This project demonstrates **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** in Python.  
It allows you to:
- Load a CSV dataset
- Train a regression model
- Evaluate model accuracy
- Visualize predictions (2D and 3D plots)
- Predict values based on user input

## ⚙️ Requirements
Install dependencies before running the project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

requirements.txt (example)
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib


▶️ How to Run

Clone this repository:
git clone git@github.com:GajendraNA/simple-linear-regression.git
cd simple-linear-regression

Run the main file:
python main.py


Follow the on-screen instructions:
Select a CSV file
Enter test size (e.g., 0.2 for 20% test split)
View predictions and graphs
Try custom user input predictions

📊 Example Workflow
Load dataset from a CSV file
Train MLR model

Evaluate accuracy:
Our model is 95.23% accurate


Visualize results:
2D plot (Predicted vs Actual values)
3D plot (Inputs vs Predictions)

📝 Notes
Place your dataset CSV files in the project directory.
Ensure the dataset’s last column is the target (Y) and the rest are features (X).
Temporary files like __pycache__/ and .ipynb_checkpoints/ should be ignored via .gitignore.
